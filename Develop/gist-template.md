In web development, validating user input is a crucial task, especially when it comes to ensuring that email addresses are in the correct format. One way to achieve this is through the use of regular expressions, or regex. This tutorial will break down the components of a regex pattern that matches email addresses, explaining how each part contributes to identifying a valid email address.

## Summary

The regex we'll be discussing is used to match a standard email address format:

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

This pattern ensures that the email has a valid format, such as example@domain.com. We'll break down each component of this regex to understand how it works.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

The ^ and $ symbols are anchors in regex that mark the start and end of the string, respectively. They ensure that the regex pattern matches the entire string, not just a part of it.

* ^ asserts the position at the start of the string.
* $ asserts the position at the end of the string.
